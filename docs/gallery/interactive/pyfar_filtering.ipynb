    "## Filtering pyfar Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering signals is a very common task in acoustics signal processing and pyfar provides three different `filter classes` for storing and applying filters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FIR Filter:** Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are non-recursive filters. FIR filters are very flexible and can have arbitrary magnitude and phase responses. One example for an FIR filter is an impulse response.\n",
    "- **IIR Filter:** Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters are recursive filters. They can achieve steeper filter slopes than FIR filters of the same order but are less flexible with respect to the phase response.\n",
    "- **SOS Filter:** Second Order Section (SOS) filters are cascaded 2nd order recursive filters. They are often more robust against numerical errors than IIR filters of the same order and are thus the most common way of realizing IIR filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a users perspective the type of filter does not matter too much, because filtering works exactly the same for all three filter classes. The following examples show how to create and apply filter objects to audio signals using a simple IIR filter."

See the `filter type` examples for an overview. Using the *filter* module is the simplest way to filter a pyfar Signal object. As the following example of a low-pass shows, the function in the *filter* module take a Signal object as their input and directly output the filtered Signal object."
