    "In acoustics research, we often deal with different coordinate systems when handling sampling points. This can get complicated. That's why we have the Coordinates class in pyfar. The [pyfar.Coordinates](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/classes/pyfar.coordinates.html) was designed for storing, working with, and accessing coordinate points. You can easily switch between different coordinate systems, rotate points, and do other useful stuff. For example, you can store microphone positions in a spherical microphone array or loudspeaker positions in a sound field synthesis system."
